# motivationCalendar Proposal

Jason Fujii

In the past, especially with Covid and a lockdown looming over everyone's shoulders, it can be difficult to get anything done. Basic tasks like making your bed everyday, drinking enough water, and even eating enough food can be challenging for those who face the negative impacts of the lockdown. 

One method that I have used in the past to get out of these depressive funks is making daily goals for myself. When I finish one of these tasks, I get to draw a line in specific, predetermined color through the day that I completed it in my calendar. The goal of this is to continue the line for as long as possible; creating a fun challenge for yourself while also working on improving your mental health and creating healthy habits. 

Motivation Calendar (MC) will be that idea, but on a smart phone, something that everyone carries on them at all times. When they complete a task, they open MC, check off that task for the day, and a line is automatically added to their calendar. If they forget to complete that task by a certain time, they are gently reminded through a notification.

# WireFrame Description

Page 1: Home Page
Upon opening the app, Users will see a calendar that displays the month, and the completion of their goals (signified via colored lines). Underneath the calendar section, a color key will appear. This will show the daily goals that the user has and what color on the calendar signifies them. Underneath the color key, there will be a button labeled "Goals" that will take the user to the "Goals Page" when clicked on (more on that on the page 2 description). Above, the user will see three buttons. In the upper left corner, a button will display that will take the user to a "Year-to-date page" (more on that on page 3 description). To the right of that, is the settings button. The user can change visual settings here. To the right of that, is a plus sign. If the user taps on this, they will be taken to a page where they can add new goals.

Page 2: Goals Page
This page will show users the data related to the completion of their goals. Daily goals will show how many times the user has completed that goals over the number of total days that the goal has been active. They will then get a percentage to signify how often they complete that goal. Long term goals are slightly different. Every time a user completes this goal, it will also show on this page, however they will see how many times they have completed it versus how many times they *want* to complete that goal. On both daily and long term goals, the user will see a progress circle to the left of it. On top, in the upper left hand corner, will be an arrow that will send the user back to the main page. To the right will be a plus sign that will allow the user to add new goals.

Page 3: Year-To-Date Page
This page will show the user the past months that they have been using the app. It will also show them all of the data for the goals they have completed in the past. Below the calendar, a color key will appear and show what goals exist and what colors signify them on the calendar. At the top, there will be a back arrow to allow the users to go back to the main page.
